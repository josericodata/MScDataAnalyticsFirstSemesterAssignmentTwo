Please review the CCT Grade Descriptor available on the module Moodle page for a detailed description of the standard of work required for each grade band.

The grading system in CCT is the QQI percentage grading system and is in common use in higher education institutions in Ireland. The pass mark and thresholds for different grade bands may be different from what you have experienced in the higher education system in other countries. CCT grades must be considered in the context of the grading system in Irish higher education and not assumed to represent the same standard the percentage grade reflects when awarded in an international context.

**Assessment Task**

Students are advised to review and adhere to the submission requirements documented after the assessment task.

***Scenario***

***Transport in Ireland***

*“Smartcard ticketing systems currently available in many cities’ public transport systems enable a vast amount of data.*

*These datasets reflect how people behave, which in turn means it is possible to assess their transport needs and provide an accurate picture of their habits, either as groups (based on fare types, such as student, elderly and so on) or at an individual level.*

*Thanks to big data analytics, we can adapt public transport to these needs, plan new services, minimise walking time and so on.”—* *https://www.engineersireland.ie/Brexit/big-data-enables-better-urban-transport-networks*

**You have been tasked with analysing Ireland's Transport data and comparing the Irish Transport sector with other countries (of your choosing) worldwide.** This analysis should also include forecasting, sentiment analysis and evidence-based recommendations for the sector as well as a complete rationale of the entire process used to discover your findings. Your Research could include vehicle traffic, type of vehicles used, freight transport, air traffic, transport infrastructure etc. (or any other relevant topic EXCEPT Climate change) with Ireland as your base line.

**Note:**

## 1. Introduction

In this assignment, we deep dive into some aspects of the Irish transport sector, conducting a multifaceted analysis that extends to various key dimensions. With a specific focus on programming, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, our examination goes beyond the surface, comparing Ireland's transport landscape with selected EU nations. By employing a diverse array of methodologies, we aim to provide clarity in some of the aspects of the sector's strengths, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. This introduction sets the stage for a thorough exploration, offering valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors shaping the Irish transport sector within the broader European context.

## 2. Programming

### 2.1. Programming

I organized the project into five Jupyter Notebooks:\
CA2_ML_Code.ipynb, CA2_Programming_Code.ipynb, CA2_Statistics_Code.ipynb and CA2_Data_Visualisation.ipynb. The project is programmatically explored using Python, emphasizing modularity and narrative-style programming.

### 2.2. Data Structures

For this project I gathered and processed data from:

CSV file:

Figure 1

Web API in CSV format:

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated](img/image2.png)

Figure 2

Eurostat module:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image3.png)

Figure 3

Also, I explored gathering data from a:

Web API in JSON format:

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated](img/image4.png)

Figure 4

The entire parsing process is documented in "CA2_Programming_Code_sba23021.ipynb" from cell 8 to 17 (Goel, 2020).

MySQL database:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image5.png)

Figure 5

As I could not find an open MySQL database to connect, I will be demonstrating how to extract data from a local MySQL database. I created a table named "tran_hv_psmod" within a schema called "eurostat" and imported the previously fetched file from Eurostat, "TRAN_HV_PSMOD.csv":

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image6.png)

Figure 6

Once I had the records in the table, I was able to retrieve them using the Python package "sqlalchemy" (Oyama, 2022):

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image7.png)

Figure 7

Complete instructions on creating the table, pushing, and fetching records are provided in the annex (8.1. MySQL Setup) (dev.mysql.com, n.d.).

### 2.3. Documentation

In terms of documentation, I endeavoured to provide comments explaining the rationale behind each line of code. This includes details about the purpose of each line and the workflow for data manipulation and visualization.

I maintained code quality standards by adhering to the "PEP 8" styling guidelines (van Rossum, Warsaw and Coghlan, 2001). Given the project's nature, which primarily involves data manipulation and visualization, there was no need for the introduction of complex programming constructs or advanced "OOP" principles. My objective was to ensure clean and modularized code.

### 2.4. Testing and Optimization

#### 2.4.1. Testing

I have conducted extensive testing in the statistical section, examining each scenario to ensure the statistical model fits appropriately. Furthermore, I refined the testing process when accepting the null hypothesis. All statistical models in "CA2_Statistics_Code_sba23021.ipynb" are implemented after thorough testing.\
Now, we are going to explore a testing example for a hypothesis test involving two populations.

This table will help us formulate the hypothesis:

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image8.png)

Figure 8

H0: mu IE_BUS = mu EU_Country_BUS; There is no significant difference between the percentage average on passenger-kilometres for Vehicle BUS in Ireland and EU_Country.

H1: mu IE_BUS != mu EU_Country_BUS; There is a significant difference between the percentage average on passenger-kilometres for Vehicle BUS in Ireland and EU_Country.

Let us start the testing and choose Italy to determine whether we accept or reject the null hypothesis:

![A white rectangular object with black text Description automatically generated](img/image9.png)

Figure 9

![A graph of a bus Description automatically generated](img/image10.png)

Figure 10

We can clearly see that H0 is rejected therefore there is a significant difference in the average percentage of BUS passengers between Ireland and Italy.

Now we are going to select Slovenia as its mu is closer to the Irish one:

![A white rectangular box with black text Description automatically generated](img/image11.png)

Figure 11

![A graph of a normal distribution Description automatically generated](img/image12.png)

Figure 12

We accept H0 and conclude that there is not enough evidence to say that there is a significant difference between the percentage average on passenger-kilometres for vehicle BUS in Ireland and Slovenia.

There is another testing scenario in annex 8.1.2.

#### 2.4.2. Optimization

Good examples of optimization can be found in "CA2_ML_Code_sba23021.ipynb", where I enriched the datasets to achieve better accuracy in machine learning models.

I observed a low accuracy of 69.23% for SVC and the best score at 90.88% (C: 1000, Gamma=0.01). I identified that the model was not fitting properly at Gamma = 0.0001.

After enriching the dataset, I achieved an accuracy of 87.01% for SVC, with the best score at 91.88% (C: 1000, Gamma=0.001). The results indicate a less overfitted model as the best score is obtained at a higher Gamma. Additionally, the graph at Gamma=0.0001 shows that the test and train sets are more fitted after enrichment.\
In the annex 8.1.2 we can find other two scenarios for optimization.

![A graph of different values Description automatically generated](img/image13.png)

Figure 13

### 2.5. Data Manipulation

In analyzing different data sources, I utilized various libraries and techniques for both processing and aggregating data (GeeksforGeeks, 2020). The comparisons and contrasts for each data source are summarized in Figure X, and the detailed implementation and explanation of the code can be found in "CA2_Programming_Code_sba23021.ipynb."

## 3. Statistical Analysis

### 3.1. Descriptive Statistics

#### 3.1.1. Dataset for Confidence Interval

Dataset used is "tii03-passenger-journeys-by-luas". We aim to estimate the range of potential values for the parameter "LUAS average passenger number".\
Below are the descriptive statistics for the total LUAS passenger numbers (green and red lines) for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022:

![A table with numbers and a number on it Description automatically generated](img/image15.png)

Figure 15

We will be examining the mean values to establish the confidence intervals.\
It is interesting to note that both lines are quite balanced in terms of usage.

![A group of pie charts with numbers Description automatically generated](img/image16.png)

Figure 16

In Section 3.2, a detailed analysis of confidence intervals will be conducted for this dataset.

#### 3.1.2. Dataset for Hypothesis Test Two Populations

In this section we are comparing Ireland with some European countries, formulating hypothesis to assess if there are statistically significant differences in the "percentage average passenger-kilometres based on type of transport (Bus, Car and Train".\
Since we will be using Ireland mean against other countries mean, this plot will assist us in constructing the hypothesis:

![A group of colorful bars Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image17.png)

Figure 17

The dataset used is "Modal split of inland passenger transport" with the Eurostat code "TRAN_HV_PSMOD."

#### 3.1.3. Dataset for ANOVA One-Way

Using Irish airports as a reference, an ANOVA will be conducted to test whether there are any statistically significant differences in the means compared to other European airports. The dataset used is "Air passenger transport by main airports in each reporting country" with the Eurostat code "AVIA_PAOA."

In the first scenario Dublin Airport is considered, and below a graph of the subset of airports selected for this case:

![A group of colorful bars Description automatically generated](img/image18.png)

Figure 18

In the second scenario, Shannon Airport is considered, and below is a graph showing the subset of airports selected for this case:

![A group of colorful bars Description automatically generated](img/image19.png)

Figure 19

#### 3.1.4. Dataset for Chi-Squared Test

This test will be performed to examine the association between the categorical variable "Motor_energy_type" for Ireland and Austria. The dataset used is "New passenger cars by type of motor energy" with the Eurostat code "road_eqr_carpda."

This model is highly sensitive to the frequency of the variables. I have presented two cases: one where we reject H0, and the second one where I manually changed values to accept H0. I will now illustrate how the categorical variable numbers will look for each case, with further analysis to follow in "3.3.1.3. Chi-squared test."

Scenario 1: Rejecting H0.

![A graph of a number of cars Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image20.png)

Figure 20

Scenario 2: Accepting H0.

![A graph of different types of cars Description automatically generated](img/image21.png)

Figure 21

#### 3.1.5. Dataset for Kruskal-Wallis

For this test, I utilized the same dataset as for ANOVA. Some of the airports violated the assumptions of normality required for ANOVA. The advantage of using the Kruskal-Wallis test is that it does not require normality to perform the test. I will present two scenarios: one to accept H0 and another to reject H0.

Scenario 1: Accepting H0.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image22.png)

Figure 22

Scenario 2: Rejecting H0.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image23.png)

Figure 23

#### 3.1.6. Dataset for U-Mann Whitney

I used a new dataset for this test, "Passengers transported (Railway transport)", with the Eurostat code "rail_pa_total" because the data did not follow a normal distribution. This choice allowed me to demonstrate the test's capability to handle non-normally distributed data.

Scenario 1: Accepting H0.

![A number on a white background Description automatically generated](img/image24.png)

Figure 24

Scenario 2: Rejecting H0.

![A number on a white background Description automatically generated](img/image25.png)

Figure 25

### 3.2. Confidence Interval

The task is to determine the weekly LUAS average for the total number of passengers in the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. It is important to note that both LUAS lines (red and green) are in scope. The analysis will be conducted with a 90% confidence level, and here are the results:

![A table with numbers and a few black text Description automatically generated](img/image26.png)

Figure 26

E.g. At a 90% confidence level, for 2019 the weekly LUAS number of passengers average is between 453K and 472K. Subsequently the same formulation for the rest of the years.

Plotting the confidence intervals:

![A group of graphs showing different sizes of data Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image27.png)

Figure 27

After performing confidence intervals, the next natural step is to verify if the weekly averages are the same for both the red and green LUAS lines. We will use a t-test (www.statisticslectures.com, n.d.).

Hypothesis:

H0: μ green line = μ red line.\
H1: μ green line != μ red line.

Results:

Figure 29

![A table with numbers and text Description automatically generated](img/image30.png)

Figure 30

At a 5% significance level, we accept the Null Hypothesis; there is not enough evidence to conclude that the weekly mean values for the LUAS green line are different from those of the red line.

### 3.3. Inferential Statistics

#### 3.3.1. Parametric

##### 3.3.1.1. T-test Two Populations

To perform this test, we will compare Ireland with three different countries, each having a distinct transportation method. The first scenario involves comparing Ireland with Slovenia for cars, the second compares Ireland with Denmark for buses, and the third compares Ireland with Slovenia again, but this time for trains.

Hypothesis:

H0: μ Ireland = μ EU Country.

H1: μ Ireland != μ EU Country.

Results:

![A graph of a normal distribution Description automatically generated](img/image31.png)

Figure 31

Since the p-value is greater than alpha, we accept the null hypothesis (H0). There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference between the percentage average of passenger-kilometres for the BUS vehicle in Ireland and Slovenia.

![A graph of a normal distribution Description automatically generated](img/image32.png)

Figure 32

As the p-value is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis (H0), providing sufficient evidence to conclude a significant difference in the percentage average of passenger-kilometres for the Car vehicle between Ireland and Denmark.

![A graph of a normal distribution Description automatically generated](img/image33.png)

Figure 33

As the p-value is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis (H0), indicating sufficient evidence to conclude a significant difference in the percentage average of passenger-kilometres for the Train vehicle between Ireland and Slovenia.

##### 3.3.1.2. ANOVA One-Way

In the first scenario, we examine Dublin, Zurich, and Copenhagen airports to verify whether the yearly average passenger numbers for the period from 2003 to 2022 are the same or not (Laerd Statistics, 2018).

To perform ANOVA, we need both Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests to have p-values greater than 5% alpha.

![A screenshot of a test results Description automatically generated](img/image35.png)

Figure 35

Now we can perform ANOVA:

H0: μ IE_EIDW = μ CH_LSZH = μ DK_EKCH.

H1: there are at least 2 μ that are different one to another.

Result p-value = 0.889

![A graph of a flight Description automatically generated](img/image36.png)

Figure 36

There is no reason to reject the Null Hypothesis; therefore, we can conclude that, with a 5% alpha, the mean of annual passengers carried (2003-2022) for Dublin, Zurich and Copenhagen airports is quite similar.

Second scenario: Shannon, Billund, and Treviso airports. We want to verify if the yearly average passenger numbers for the period 2003 to 2022 are the same or not.

Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests:

![A screenshot of a test Description automatically generated](img/image37.png)

Figure 37

ANOVA hypothesis:

H0: μ IE_EINN= μ IT_LIPH= μ DK_EKBI.

H1: there are at least 2 μ that are different one to another.

Result p-value = 0.04

![A graph of a flight Description automatically generated](img/image38.png)

Figure 38

We fail to accept the Null Hypothesis; therefore, we can state that with a 5% alpha the mean of annual passengers carried (2003-2022) for Shannon, Treviso-Sant'Angelo and Billund airports is different.

##### 3.3.1.3. Chi-squared test

First Scenario:

Hypothesis:

H0: There is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies. Ireland and Austria are independent with no association or relationship.

![A screenshot of a number of numbers Description automatically generated](img/image39.png)

Figure 39

H1: There is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies, indicating a non-independent relationship between Ireland and Austria

Result p-value = 1.64e-14, we fail to accept H0.

![A graph of a car Description automatically generated](img/image40.png)

Figure 40

In the second scenario, I manually adjusted values for Austria to align frequencies more closely with those of Ireland; this model is highly sensitive to substantial differences between categorical variables.

![A screenshot of a number Description automatically generated](img/image41.png)

Figure 41

After applying the Chi-Square test, we obtained a p-value of 0.59, leading us to accept H0.

![A graph of a car Description automatically generated](img/image42.png)

#### 3.3.2. Non-parametric

##### 3.3.2.1. Kruskal-Wallis

Scenario 1:

We do not have normality for our samples (Xia, 2020):

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image43.png)

Figure 43

Hypothesis:

H0: μ IE_EIKN= μ FR_LFBP= μ SE_ESGP.

H1: there are at least 2 μ that are different one to another.

Result, p-value = 0.23511.

![A graph of a line Description automatically generated](img/image44.png)

Figure 44

We accept H0; the means of annual passengers carried (2003-2022) for Ireland West Knock, Pau Pyrenees, and Goteborg airports are quite similar.

Scenario 2:

We do not have normality for our samples:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image45.png)

Figure 45

Hypothesis:

H0: μ IE_EIKY= μ DE_EDSB= μ PL_EPRZ.

H1: there are at least 2 μ that are different one to another.

Result, p-value = 8.48e-08

![A graph of a passenger carrier Description automatically generated](img/image46.png)

Figure 46

We fail to accept H0; the means of annual passengers carried (2003-2022) for Kerry, Karlsruhe/Baden, and Rzeszow-Jasionka airports are different.

##### 3.3.2.2. U-Mann Whitman

Scenario 1:

Checking normality:

![A white rectangular object with black text Description automatically generated](img/image47.png)

Figure 47

Hypothesis:

H0: μ Ireland = μ Croatia.

H1: μ Ireland != μ Croatia.

Result p-value = 0.3068

![A graph of a train passenger Description automatically generated](img/image48.png)

Figure 48

As the p-value is greater than alpha, we accept H0, indicating that there is no significant difference between the average number of train passengers in Ireland and Croatia.

Scenario 2:

Checking normality:

![A white background with black text Description automatically generated](img/image49.png)

Hypothesis:

H0: μ Ireland = μ Slovakia.

H1: μ Ireland != μ Slovakia.

Result p-value = 3.45e-06

![A graph of a train passenger Description automatically generated](img/image50.png)

Figure 50

We reject H0 as p-value is lower than alpha, there is a significant difference between the average number of train passengers between Ireland and Slovakia.

### 3.4. Further Research and Challenges Faced

The tests I have conducted above reveal interesting findings:

"Number of public transport journeys at highest level since the beginning of the pandemic" (BreakingNews.ie, 2022), based on the confidence intervals, we can confirm that the number of passengers is recovering:

![A graph of a number of people Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image51.png)

Figure 51

"Paris Charles De Gaulle recorded the highest number of air passengers" (ec.europa.eu, n.d.). "Dublin Airport Was EU's 11th Largest Airport in 2018" (DublinAirport, n.d.):

![A graph of different colored bars Description automatically generated](img/image52.png)

Figure 52

Analysing means in the ANOVA section we can see that those headings are highly correlated with "FR_LFPG" and "IE_EIDW."

The challenges faced included gathering the data and establishing the scenarios to perform the tests.

## 4. ML

### 4.1. Supervised Learning

The choice of the dataset "TRAN_HV_PSMOD" and the selection of supervised ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine) are purely matters of modelling. After numerous attempts, this combination has proven effective (Thanh Noi and Kappas, 2017).

We will be modelling the dataset to see how models react having these classes:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image54.png)

Figure 54

I paired Ireland with Hungary because it showed the best performance association for selected ML models, here are the results:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image55.png)

Figure 55

Overall model is performing well however for Gamma = 0.0001, models seem to be overfitted (Kilic, 2023) as this score is lower compared to Gamma 0.01 and 0.001:

![A graph of a graph with numbers Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image56.png)

Figure 56

To address the issue of overfitting (Ghosh, 2023), I enriched the dataset by quarterly weighting yearly values:

![A close-up of a number Description automatically generated](img/image57.png)

Figure 57

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image58.png)

Figure 58

The results are as follows:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image59.png)

Figure 59

![A graph of a number of numbers Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image60.png)

Figure 60

Now we have a better fit, with higher scores observed at Gamma = 0.0001.

### 4.2. Cross Validation and Feature Reduction

Ireland will be our target variable for each transportation method. In the first attempt with yearly data, we obtained the following results:

![A screenshot of a number of features Description automatically generated](img/image61.png)

Figure 61

After quarterly enrichment, increasing the number of rows from 32 to 128, we obtained the following results:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image62.png)

Figure 62

Linear regression estimation has performed much better with enriched data.

### 4.3. Unsupervised Learning

Dataset it is split into each mode of transportation having Ireland as a reference.

First attempt with quarterly data we get the following results:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image63.png)

Figure 63

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image64.png)

Figure 64

To improve the results, we are going to enhance the dataset by breaking down each year into monthly values. The results are as follows:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image65.png)

Figure 65

![A screen shot of a number Description automatically generated](img/image66.png)

Figure 66

KMeans and PCA have performed better with more data (L, 2020).

### 4.4. Sentiment Analysis

We are going to conduct sentiment analysis using Ryanair reviews and a set of tweets related to USA airlines. Results:

![A comparison of a number of squares Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image67.png)

Figure 67

Tweets dataset is larger than Ryanair one that explains more correctly classified inputs:

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image68.png)

Figure 68

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image69.png)

Figure 69

Model accuracy for Ryanair is 73% and 75% for USA Airlines. ROC results as it follows:

![A graph of a curve Description automatically generated](img/image70.png)

Figure 70

USA Airlines seem to be classifying bad inputs better, while the other two are closer to each other. Let us test the classifier by adding reviews:

![A screenshot of a computer program Description automatically generated](img/image71.png)

Figure 71

Result:

![A graph of different sizes and colors Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image72.png)

Figure 72

Ryanair's sentiment analysis performs well even though it has fewer inputs than USA Airlines. This difference could be attributed to the collection of reviews from Tripadvisor, where I ensured capturing opinions across good, bad, and neutral categories.

### 4.5. Table and Conclusions

#### 4.5.1. Supervised Learning

Let us compare each model after enriching the dataset.

By adding more values, models have performed better, with the exception of RF. However, we solved overfitting in the hyperparameter tuning phase, achieving higher accuracy at a lower level of gamma.

#### 4.5.2. Cross Validation and Feature Reduction

Same approach as we followed previously, we increased dataset row count by breaking down years into quarters, here the results:

After enriching the data, the first principal component explains almost 97% of the variability for the CAR and BUS datasets, while the TRN dataset exhibits 76.86% variability on the first component. This demonstrates a clear improvement.\
The silhouette score has improved, indicating that the clusters are now closer to being well-defined (closer to +1). Additionally, all plots demonstrate a clear improvement after enlarging the dataset.

## 5. Data Preparation and Visualization

### 5.1. Data acquisition

Undoubtedly, this was the most challenging part of the assignment. However, I discovered the Eurostat website, which provides extensive content on data transportation. Additionally, the CSO offers interesting datasets related to the Irish transportation sector. Other platforms utilized included GitHub, Kaggle, and TripAdvisor.

A positive aspect of this research is that I discovered platforms such as Eurostat, which even has a Python package to download its datasets. On the negative side, the length of transportation datasets I found was a challenge for the machine learning part. There was not enough data to create accurate and consistent models. However, I found a solution to overcome this issue.

In terms of licenses, we are mostly covered by Creative Commons, allowing us to use these datasets. Only for Tripadvisor Ryanair reviews, I do not have licenses. After thorough research, I believe I am not infringing any law, as I am not collecting any personal data. I am compliant with GDPR (Your Europe, 2019), and Tripadvisor does not state that you cannot collect their reviews for research purposes.

![A white text on a black background Description automatically generated](img/image88.png)

Figure 88

### 5.2. EDA methodology

One of the issues was that Eurostat uses its nomenclature, and each dataset needed to be crosschecked to obtain accurate numbers. However, the main challenge was adapting datasets for the statistical models. EDA for this section can be found in "CA2_Data_Visualisation_Code_sba23021.ipynb" and some explanation in the annex (8.3.1). Nevertheless, EDA is also prevalent throughout the entire assignment. Here is a summary of the EDA performed:

![A white sheet with black text Description automatically generated](img/image89.png)

Figure 89

### 5.3. EDA ML implementation

For ML I utilized "TRAN_HV_PSMOD" due to the versatility this dataset provides for modeling both supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as for cross-validation and feature reduction. Additionally, the dataset enabled a comparison of Ireland's modal split transport with that of other European countries.

The challenge lay in improving accuracy. The solution involved breaking down years into quarters for both supervised and cross-validation/feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, I subdivided years into months to leverage the increased data availability. Undoubtedly, the models performed better with the additional data.

#### Quarterly enrichment:

#### Monthly enrichment:

![A screenshot of a computer code Description automatically generated](img/image94.png)

![A comparison of a graph Description automatically generated](img/image95.png)

All EDA for ML can be seen in "CA2_ML_Code_sba23021.ipynb". I also created a more concise version "CA2_Data_Visualisation_Code_sba23021.ipynb", which emphasizes the relevant aspects of the EDA. Additional information is available in the annex (8.3.2).

### 5.4. Dashboard

The rationale and visualization choices can be seen in the table below, as follows:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](img/image96.png)

As mentioned above I developed a dashboard in "CA2_Data_Visualisation_Code_sba23021.ipynb" outlining the relevant results for ML models. To comply with point "Modern Transport planning has a great dependence... web based" I adapted the dashboard to a streamlit (Parker, 2023) web dashboard. You can visit it at: <https://datavisualisationmoderntransportdashstudentsba23021.streamlit.app/>.

Complete dashboards can also be viewed in the annex (8.3.3).

## 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, the assignment most formidable phase involved the collection and adaptation of data for diverse methodologies. While my findings may not offer a panacea for the challenges faced by the Irish Transportation sector, I am confident that the statistical tests and Machine Learning models employed are presented in an accessible and pragmatic manner. This journey underscored the intricacies of data integration and analysis, highlighting the importance of methodological clarity. As I reflect on the complexities encountered, I recognize that this study contributes to a nuanced understanding of the sector. While not providing all-encompassing solutions, it lays the groundwork for informed discussions and potential pathways toward addressing the intricacies of the Irish Transportation landscape. I believe that the transparent modeling and interpretability fostered in this study pave the way for future endeavors in unraveling the challenges inherent in the field of transportation.

This is how we can connect to a MySQL database and pull data from there.

#### 8.1.2. Testing and Optimization

**Testing:**

The choice of selecting Hungary, along with Ireland, for the Supervised Learning models was not a random decision. I tested the models with each possible combination involving Ireland and another country, and the pair of Ireland and Hungary offered the best outcome. In "CA2_Programming_Code_sba23021.ipynb" I implemented the models for Ireland and the Netherlands here the results:

Results for Ireland and the Netherlands:

### 8.3. Data Visualization

#### 8.3.1. EDA Methodology

EDA Confidence Intervals.

We are dropping "All Luas lines" except for the red and green lines for modeling purposes:

![A graph of different sizes and colors Description automatically generated with medium confidence](img/image163.png)

Figure 163

We are also dropping the year 2023 due to missing data; modeling under such conditions is not feasible.
